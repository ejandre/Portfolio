      <p>Although it was founded more than 60 years ago, the impact and influence of Motown on music, as well as the world, still exists today. Not only did it change the face of music by helping black artists gain worldwide recognition on a massive scale, but it did so in the midst of a racially divided society, where the odds were stacked against them.

      <p>The birth of Motown began in 1959, when Berry Gordy, a young songwriter from Detroit Michigan, used an $800 loan from his family to found his own record company, coining it “Motown”, as Detroit has long been known as the “Motor City”.

      <p>From there, Gordy approached the music business as an assembly line, creating an environment in which a “kid off the street could walk in one door, an unknown, go through a process, and come out the other door, a star”

      <p>The system worked, becoming the biggest pop music hit factory the world had ever seen, churning out artists such as Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, and Michael Jackson, who collectively helped define the “Sound of Young America”, influencing generations of future artists.
